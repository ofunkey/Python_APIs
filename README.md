# Python_APIs

## Background
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

### WeatherPy
In this report, Python script is created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, a simple Python library is utilized, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a representative model of weather across world cities.

#### The objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
![temp](https://github.com/ofunkey/Python_APIs/blob/master/Python_APIs/MaxTemp_vs_Latitude.png 'temp')

* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
![humid](https://github.com/ofunkey/Python_APIs/blob/master/Python_APIs/Lat_vs_Humidity.png 'humid')

* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
![cloudy](https://github.com/ofunkey/Python_APIs/blob/master/Python_APIs/Lat_vs_Cloudiness.png 'cloudy')

* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
![humid](https://github.com/ofunkey/Python_APIs/blob/master/Python_APIs/MaxTemp_vs_Latitude.png 'humid')
