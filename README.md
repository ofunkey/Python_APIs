# Python_APIs

## Background
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

### WeatherPy
In this report, Python script is created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, a simple Python library is utilized, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a representative model of weather across world cities.

#### The objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
